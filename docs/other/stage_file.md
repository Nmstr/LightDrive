# LightDrive Visualizer Stage Files (.lds)

These files store stages for the Visualizer in JSON Format. They contain the stage model, the fixtures
and all universes.

!!! WARNING
    Visualizer Stage Files do not currently store the stage model and fixtures, but just references them.
    To share a stage, you need to share the stage model and fixtures as well and have them in the same
    location. This will change in the future.
